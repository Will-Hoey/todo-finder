## TODO


# Priority

- [ ] Integrate with Github actions (Run script as an action and comment on the PR with a list of the TODOs)
- [ ] Allow for custom file types to be specified. "\*.js" for example
- [ ] Review the `RES[n-1]` statements as if the file is deeply nested, not enough information will be present.

# Backlog (Ideas that may not be possible)

- [ ] Integrate with pre-push hook. Setup to remind of TODOs before a branch push (Optional)
- [ ] Use "git blame" to find who added the TODO and when (Maybe commit hash?)
